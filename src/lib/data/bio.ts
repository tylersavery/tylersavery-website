Hi, I'm Tyler Savery — a full-stack software developer based in Toronto, Canada. I've been coding since I was a kid and have spent the last 15 years building professional-grade digital products. I specialize in helping startups define and launch their MVPs, and I love turning ambitious ideas into polished, scalable platforms.

Much of my development work happens through my agency, [The Young Astronauts](https://theyoungastronauts.com), which operates between Toronto and LA. We've collaborated with clients across entertainment, e-commerce, and tech startups, always with an eye toward thoughtful UX and modern, maintainable code.

My current toolkit includes Python + Django, Dart + Flutter, and JavaScript + SvelteKit — though I'm always refining my stack to stay efficient and current. I also have a strong passion for UX design and, thanks to tools like Tailwind CSS, I can occasionally make things look as good as they work.

I'm equally passionate about sharing knowledge. My [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TylerCodes)  channel covers both beginner-friendly and advanced topics in full-stack development, and it's a great resource if you're looking to level up your skills.

Outside of work, I enjoy making music, exploring the outdoors, and playing everything from board games to video games — though these days, most of my free time is joyfully claimed by my toddler, Lane.

Thanks for stopping by. I've got some exciting things planned for this space — stay tuned!
